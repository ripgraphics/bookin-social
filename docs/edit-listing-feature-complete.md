## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive edit listing feature with a professional dropdown menu UI (3-dot vertical icon) containing Edit and Delete options.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Created Files

#### `app/hooks/useEditModal.ts`
- Zustand store for managing edit modal state
- Tracks modal open/closed state and the listing ID being edited
- Provides `onOpen(listingId)` and `onClose()` methods

#### `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx`
- Full-featured modal for editing existing listings
- Mirrors RentModal structure with 6 steps: Category, Location, Info, Images, Description, Price
- Fetches existing listing data via GET API endpoint
- Pre-populates all form fields with current listing data
- Supports multi-image upload (up to 35 images) with 16:9 aspect ratio
- Multi-line inputs for title (2 lines) and description (6 lines with paragraph support)
- Calls PATCH API endpoint to save changes

### 2. Updated Files

#### `app/api/listings/[listingId]/route.ts`
Added three HTTP methods:

**GET**: Fetch single listing by ID
- No authentication required (public endpoint)
- Returns listing with proper field name mapping (camelCase)
- Parses `image_src` JSON array if needed

**PATCH**: Update existing listing
- Requires authentication
- Verifies ownership (only owner can edit)
- TODO: Add admin role check for admin editing
- Updates all listing fields
- Returns updated listing data

**DELETE**: Delete listing (already existed, kept for reference)
- Requires authentication and ownership

#### `app/listings/[listingId]/ListingClient.tsx`
Added professional dropdown menu UI:

**Features**:
- 3-dot vertical icon button (HiDotsVertical from react-icons)
- Dropdown menu with Edit and Delete options
- Click-outside detection to auto-close dropdown
- Ownership verification (only shows for listing owner)
- Edit option: Opens EditModal with listing ID
- Delete option: Prompts confirmation, deletes listing, redirects to home
- Loading state during delete operation
- Professional styling with hover effects

**UI Elements**:
- Rounded button with hover background
- Dropdown positioned absolutely, right-aligned
- Shadow and border for dropdown container
- Icons for each menu item (edit/delete)
- Red styling for delete option
- Disabled state styling during delete operation

#### `app/layout.tsx`
- Imported and added `<EditModal />` to the layout
- Positioned after SearchModal and before RentModal

## Features

### User Experience
1. **Ownership Check**: Dropdown menu only visible to listing owner
2. **Edit Flow**: Click 3-dot icon → Click "Edit Listing" → Modal opens with pre-filled data → Make changes → Click "Update"
3. **Delete Flow**: Click 3-dot icon → Click "Delete Listing" → Confirm → Listing deleted → Redirect to home
4. **Click Outside**: Dropdown automatically closes when clicking outside
5. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, hover effects, disabled states

### Security
- Authentication required for PATCH and DELETE operations

- Confirmation prompt before deletion

### Data Handling

## UI Components

### Dropdown Menu Structure
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  [3-dot icon]       │ ← Button with hover effect
└─────────────────────┘
        ↓ (on click)
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  📝 Edit Listing       │ ← Edit option
├─────────────────────────┤
│  🗑️ Delete Listing    │ ← Delete option (red)
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Icon Options (Available but using HiDotsVertical)
- `HiDotsVertical` - 3 vertical dots (currently used) ✓
- `BsGear` - Gear/settings icon
- `HiOutlineDotsVertical` - Outlined 3 dots
- `BsThreeDotsVertical` - Alternative 3 dots

## Future Enhancements (TODO)

### Admin Role Support
To allow admins to edit any listing:

1. **Add role column to users table**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN role TEXT DEFAULT 'user';
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON public.users(role);
```

2. **Update SafeUser type** (`app/types/index.ts`):
```typescript
export type SafeUser = {
  // ... existing fields
  role?: 'user' | 'admin';
};
```

3. **Update getCurrentUser** to fetch role:
```typescript
const { data: userData } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("id, first_name, last_name, email, role, created_at, updated_at")
  // ... rest
```

4. **Update permission checks**:
```typescript
const isAdmin = currentUser?.role === 'admin';
const canEdit = isOwner || isAdmin;
```
