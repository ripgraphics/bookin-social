# EditModal Form Data Fix - Using reset() - COMPLETE

## Problem
The EditModal form submission was missing required fields (`title`, `description`, `imageSrc`, `price`) even after using `getValues()`, causing 400 errors when trying to save listing edits.

## Root Cause
Using individual `setValue()` calls to populate form fields does not guarantee that those fields will be included in `getValues()` results. This is because `setValue()` updates the internal state, but react-hook-form may not track these fields properly if they weren't "touched" or "dirty".

## Solution Applied
Replaced all individual `setValue()` calls with a single `reset()` call that reinitializes the entire form with all values at once.

## Changes Made

### File: `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx`

**Line 112-121**: Replaced individual `setValue()` calls with `reset()`:

**Before**:
```typescript
setValue('category', listing.category || '');
// ... more setValue calls for each field
setValue('guestCount', listing.guestCount || 1);
setValue('roomCount', listing.roomCount || 1);
setValue('bathroomCount', listing.bathroomCount || 1);
setValue('imageSrc', listing.imageSrc || []);
setValue('price', listing.price || 1);
setValue('title', listing.title || '');
setValue('description', listing.description || '');
```

**After**:
```typescript
reset({
  category: listing.category || '',
  guestCount: listing.guestCount || 1,
  roomCount: listing.roomCount || 1,
  bathroomCount: listing.bathroomCount || 1,
  imageSrc: listing.imageSrc || [],
  price: listing.price || 1,
  title: listing.title || '',
  description: listing.description || '',
});
```

**Line 171**: Updated useEffect dependency array:
```typescript
}, [editModal.isOpen, editModal.listingId, reset]); // Changed from setValue to reset
```

## Why This Works

1. **`reset()` reinitializes the entire form**: Unlike `setValue()` which updates individual fields, `reset()` completely reinitializes the form with new values.

2. **All fields are properly registered**: When you call `reset()`, react-hook-form ensures all fields in the object are properly tracked and registered.

3. **`getValues()` returns complete data**: After `reset()`, calling `getValues()` will return ALL fields that were passed to `reset()`, not just the ones that were "touched".

4. **Recommended by react-hook-form**: This is the official recommended approach in the react-hook-form documentation for populating forms with existing data.

## Expected Outcome

After this fix:
- ✅ `getValues()` will return all 8 required fields: `category`, `guestCount`, `roomCount`, `bathroomCount`, `imageSrc`, `price`, `title`, `description`
- ✅ The PATCH request will include all required fields
- ✅ The API will successfully update the listing (200 status instead of 400)
- ✅ The modal will close and show "Listing updated!" toast message

## Testing Instructions

1. Refresh the browser to pick up the latest changes
2. Navigate to a listing page
3. Click the 3-dot menu → Edit
4. Navigate through all steps (no need to make changes)
5. Click "Update" on the Price step
6. Check browser console for:
   - `[EditModal] Form data:` - should now include ALL 8 fields with values
   - `[EditModal] Sending PATCH request:` - should include all required fields
7. Verify the listing saves successfully:
   - 200 status in network tab
   - "Listing updated!" toast appears
   - Modal closes automatically

## Cleanup Tasks

After confirming the fix works, you can remove the debug logging:
- Lines 152-161: `console.log('[EditModal] Form populated with:', ...)`
- Lines 217-219: Debug logs in `onSubmit` function
