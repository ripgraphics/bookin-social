# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PostCSS Configuration Error
**Error:** `Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'`

**Cause:** The `postcss.config.js` was configured for Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/postcss`), but the project uses Tailwind CSS v3.

**Fix:**
- Updated `postcss.config.js` to use `tailwindcss` instead of `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- Uninstalled the incorrect `@tailwindcss/postcss` package

**Files Modified:**
- `postcss.config.js`

### 2. Missing Component: Counter.tsx
**Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '../inputs/Counter'`

**Fix:** Created `app/components/inputs/Counter.tsx` with increment/decrement functionality for guest/room/bathroom counts.

### 3. Missing Component: CategoryInput.tsx  
**Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '../inputs/CategoryInput'`

**Fix:** Created `app/components/inputs/CategoryInput.tsx` for category selection in modals.

### 4. Missing Component: Heading.tsx
**Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '../Heading'`

**Fix:** Created `app/components/Heading.tsx` for modal section headings.

### 5. Missing Component: Categories.tsx
**Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '../navbar/Categories'`

**Fix:** Created `app/components/navbar/Categories.tsx` with category navigation bar.

### 6. Missing Component: CategoryBox.tsx
**Dependency:** Required by Categories.tsx

**Fix:** Created `app/components/CategoryBox.tsx` for individual category items.

### 7. Missing Component: Container.tsx
**Dependency:** Required by Categories.tsx

**Fix:** Created `app/components/Container.tsx` for responsive container wrapper.

### 8. Missing Data File: categories.ts
**Dependency:** Required by CategoryInput.tsx

**Fix:** Created `app/data/categories.ts` with category definitions.

### 9. Merge Conflicts in app/layout.tsx
**Error:** Merge conflict markers preventing compilation

**Fix:** Resolved merge conflicts, keeping the correct imports and structure with Nunito font and all modals.
