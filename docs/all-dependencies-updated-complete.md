## Why We Skipped Some Updates

### Tailwind CSS 4.1.16 (Currently on 3.4.14)

**Why Skip:**
- Complete rewrite of the engine
- New CSS-first configuration
- Major breaking changes in config format
- Would require 2-4 hours of migration work
- All utilities work differently

**When to Upgrade:**
- Dedicate a separate session
- Plan for half-day of work
- Test extensively

**Current Status:** Tailwind v3 is perfectly stable and will be supported for years.

### Next.js 16.0.0 (Currently on 15.5.6)

**Why Skip:**
- **Still in canary/beta!**
- Not production-ready
- May have bugs
- API still changing

**When to Upgrade:**
- Wait for stable release (likely Dec 2024 or Q1 2025)
- Monitor release notes

**Current Status:** Next.js 15.5.6 is the latest **stable** version with full React 19 support!
