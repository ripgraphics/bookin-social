# Address Autocomplete Feature - Phase 1 Complete

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete âœ… | Phases 2-4 Pending Mapbox Token

## What's Been Completed

### âœ… Phase 1: Database Migration
- Created migration `0009_add_address_fields.sql`
- Added 10 new address columns to `public.listings` table:
  - `address_line1`, `address_line2`
  - `city`, `state_province`, `postal_code`
  - `country`, `country_code`
  - `formatted_address`
  - `latitude`, `longitude`
- Created indexes for efficient querying (coordinates, city, country_code)
- Migrated existing `location_value` data to `country_code` and `formatted_address`
- Kept `location_value` column for backward compatibility (can be dropped later)
- Migration successfully applied to database âœ…

### âœ… Phase 2: Geocoding Service Setup
- Installed `@mapbox/mapbox-sdk` package
- Created `lib/geocoding.ts` with utility functions:
  - `searchAddresses()` - Forward geocoding with autocomplete
  - `reverseGeocode()` - Convert coordinates to address
  - Full TypeScript types for address data

### âœ… Phase 3: Address Input Component
- Created `app/components/inputs/AddressInput.tsx`
- Features implemented:
  - Real-time address autocomplete as user types
  - Debounced search (300ms) to reduce API calls
  - Keyboard navigation (Arrow Up/Down, Enter, Escape)
  - "Use Current Location" button with geolocation API
  - Loading states and visual feedback
  - Selected address display with coordinates
  - Accessible and mobile-friendly design

### âœ… TypeScript Types Updated
- Added new address fields to `SafeListing` type
- Kept `locationValue` for backward compatibility
- Properly typed all new fields as nullable

## ðŸ”‘ CRITICAL: Mapbox API Token Required

Before proceeding with Phases 4-5, you need to set up Mapbox:

### Step 1: Get Your Free Mapbox Token

1. Go to **https://account.mapbox.com/**
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card required)
3. Once logged in, go to **"Tokens"** in the dashboard
4. Copy your **Default Public Token** (starts with `pk.`)
5. Or create a new token with these permissions:
   - `styles:tiles`
   - `styles:read`
   - `fonts:read`
   - `datasets:read`
   - `vision:read`

### Step 2: Add Token to Environment Variables

Add this line to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoieW91ci11c2VybmFtZSIsImEiOiJjbG...
```

**Important**: The token MUST start with `pk.` (public token) and be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be accessible in the browser.

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server

After adding the token:
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

---

## Next Steps (Phases 4-5)

Once the Mapbox token is added, we'll continue with:

### Phase 4: Update Forms and Display
- [ ] Replace `CountrySelect` with `AddressInput` in `RentModal.tsx`
- [ ] Replace `CountrySelect` with `AddressInput` in `EditModal.tsx`
- [ ] Update `ListingHead.tsx` to display full address
- [ ] Update `ListingInfo.tsx` to show complete address details
- [ ] Update `ListingCard.tsx` to show "City, Country" format
- [ ] Update Map component to use exact coordinates

### Phase 5: Update Backend
- [ ] Update `app/actions/getListings.ts` to select new address fields
- [ ] Update `app/actions/getListingById.ts` to select new address fields
- [ ] Update `app/api/listings/route.ts` to handle address fields in POST
- [ ] Update `app/api/listings/[listingId]/route.ts` to handle address fields in PATCH
- [ ] Test creating new listings with addresses
- [ ] Test editing existing listings
- [ ] Test search/filter by city and country

## Database State

Current listings in database (sample):

| Title | Old location_value | New country_code | New formatted_address |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| A hole in the mountain | GD | GD | GD |
| Grenada's best Cave | GD | GD | GD |
| The best cave Trinidad has to offer | TT | TT | TT |
| Tiny Garden Home in The Park | US | US | US |

All existing listings have been migrated to use `country_code` temporarily. Once users edit these listings with the new address autocomplete, they'll have full address data.

## Mapbox Free Tier Details

- **100,000 free requests per month**
- **No credit card required** for sign-up
- Includes:
  - Geocoding API (address search)
  - Directions API
  - Maps display
  - Static images

This is more than enough for a typical booking/rental application unless you have very high traffic.

## Testing Address Autocomplete

Once the token is added, test the component:

1. Create a test page or modal with the AddressInput
2. Start typing an address (e.g., "123 Main Street")
3. You should see autocomplete suggestions appear
4. Select an address to see it populated with full details
5. Try the "Use Current Location" button (requires browser permission)

---

## Troubleshooting

**If autocomplete doesn't work:**
1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is in `.env.local`
2. Verify the token starts with `pk.`
3. Restart the dev server
4. Check browser console for any error messages
5. Verify you have an active internet connection

**If "Use Current Location" doesn't work:**
1. Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost (geolocation requirement)
2. Grant browser location permissions when prompted
3. Check browser console for geolocation errors

## Ready to Continue?

Once you have your Mapbox token:
1. Add it to `.env.local`
2. Restart the dev server
3. Let me know, and I'll continue with Phases 4-5!
