# Display Issues Fixed

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Issues Resolved

### 1. "undefined, undefined" for Listing Host Name

**Problem**: The listing detail page was displaying "Hosted by undefined undefined" instead of showing the actual host's first and last name.

**Root Cause**: The `getListingById` action was only fetching listing data without joining the related user information from the `public.users` table.

**Solution**: Updated `getListingById` to include a Supabase join query:

```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  user:users!listings_user_id_fkey (
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email
  )
`)
```

The response is now transformed to include a properly formatted user object:

```typescript
user: data.user ? {
  id: data.user.id,
  firstName: data.user.first_name,
  lastName: data.user.last_name,
  email: data.user.email,
} : null,
```

**Result**: Listing pages now correctly display "Hosted by [First Name] [Last Name]"

### 2. Missing Image `src` Property Errors

**Problem**: Console was showing multiple "Image is missing required 'src' property" errors when some listings had null, undefined, or empty string values for images.

**Root Cause**: The image URL extraction logic in `ListingCard` and `ListingHead` was handling arrays but not explicitly handling null/undefined/empty values.

**Solution**: Updated both components to ensure the imageUrl is always a valid string:

```typescript
// Get first image if array, ensure not null/empty
const imageUrl = Array.isArray(imageSrc) 
  ? (imageSrc[0] || '') 
  : (imageSrc || '');
```

**Result**: No more image src errors in console, and placeholder images display correctly when listings have no images.

### 3. Missing `sizes` Prop (Performance Bonus Fix)

**Problem**: Next.js was warning that images with `fill` prop were missing the `sizes` prop, which impacts page performance.

**Solution**: Added appropriate `sizes` props to both components:

- **ListingCard**: `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"`
- **ListingHead**: `sizes="100vw"`

**Result**: Images now load more efficiently with proper size hints for responsive loading.

## Testing Instructions

2. **Test Image Handling**:
   - Check browser console for any image-related errors
   - Verify all listing cards show images or placeholders correctly
   - Verify listing detail hero images display correctly

3. **Test Performance**:
   - Open Network tab in browser dev tools
   - Verify images are loading at appropriate sizes for viewport
   - Check that no unnecessarily large images are downloaded
