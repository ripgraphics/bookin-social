# Hybrid Address UI Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a hybrid address input system that combines autocomplete search with editable address fields, providing users with maximum flexibility for entering location data.

## Phase 1: Fix API Error (COMPLETED)

### Problem
The PATCH `/api/listings/[listingId]` endpoint was returning 400 errors when editing listings because:
- The API was trying to set database fields to `undefined` values
- PostgreSQL rejects undefined values in UPDATE queries
- This occurred when address fields were not fully populated

### Solution
Updated both POST and PATCH API routes to only include defined address fields in database operations:

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/listings/route.ts`
- `app/api/listings/[listingId]/route.ts`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Only include defined fields in database update
const addressData = address ? {
  ...(address.addressLine1 !== undefined && { address_line1: address.addressLine1 }),
  ...(address.addressLine2 !== undefined && { address_line2: address.addressLine2 }),
  ...(address.city !== undefined && { city: address.city }),
  ...(address.stateProvince !== undefined && { state_province: address.stateProvince }),
  ...(address.postalCode !== undefined && { postal_code: address.postalCode }),
  ...(address.country !== undefined && { country: address.country }),
  ...(address.countryCode !== undefined && { country_code: address.countryCode }),
  ...(address.formattedAddress !== undefined && { formatted_address: address.formattedAddress }),
  ...(address.latitude !== undefined && { latitude: address.latitude }),
  ...(address.longitude !== undefined && { longitude: address.longitude }),
} : {};
```

## Phase 2: Hybrid Address UI (COMPLETED)

### New Component: AddressFieldsGroup

**File:** `app/components/inputs/AddressFieldsGroup.tsx`

A reusable component that provides editable fields for all address components:
- Street Address (required)
- Apartment/Suite/Unit (optional)
- City (required)
- State/Province (optional)
- Zip/Postal Code (optional)
- Country (required)

**Features:**
- Responsive grid layout (single column on mobile, two columns on desktop)
- Integrated with existing Input component
- Error handling support
- Disabled state support

### Updated Components

#### 1. RentModal (`app/components/modals/RentModal.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `addressFields` state to manage individual address components
- Replaced single `AddressInput` with hybrid UI:
  - Autocomplete search at the top
  - Editable address fields below
  - Map display at the bottom
- Updated `onSubmit` to construct complete address object from fields
- Address fields are reset on successful listing creation

**User Flow:**
1. User searches for address via autocomplete (optional)
2. Selected address auto-populates all fields
3. User can manually edit any field
4. User can manually enter address from scratch
5. Map updates based on latitude/longitude

#### 2. EditModal (`app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `addressFields` state to manage individual address components
- Updated `useEffect` to populate `addressFields` from existing listing data
- Replaced single `AddressInput` with hybrid UI (same as RentModal)
- Updated `onSubmit` to construct complete address object from fields
- Address fields are reset on successful listing update

**User Flow:**
1. Modal opens with existing address pre-populated in fields
2. User can search for new address via autocomplete
3. User can manually edit any individual field
4. Map updates based on current latitude/longitude

## Key Features

### 1. Flexibility
- Users can use autocomplete for quick entry
- Users can manually type/edit any field
- Both approaches work seamlessly together

### 2. Data Integrity
- Only defined fields are sent to database
- No undefined values cause errors
- Existing data is preserved when not modified

### 3. User Experience
- Autocomplete provides speed and accuracy
- Manual fields provide control and correction
- Map provides visual confirmation
- Responsive layout works on all devices

### 4. Enterprise-Grade
- Proper error handling
- Clean state management
- Reusable components
- Type-safe implementation

## Technical Details

### State Management
Each modal maintains an `addressFields` state object:
```typescript
const [addressFields, setAddressFields] = useState({
  addressLine1: '',
  addressLine2: '',
  city: '',
  stateProvince: '',
  postalCode: '',
  country: '',
  countryCode: '',
  latitude: null as number | null,
  longitude: null as number | null,
  formattedAddress: '',
});
```

### Data Flow

**Create Flow (RentModal):**
1. User interacts with autocomplete or manual fields
2. `addressFields` state updates
3. On submit, `addressData` object is constructed
4. Sent to POST `/api/listings` with all form data
5. API filters out undefined fields before database insert

**Edit Flow (EditModal):**
1. Modal opens, fetches existing listing
2. `addressFields` populated from listing data
3. User modifies via autocomplete or manual fields
4. `addressFields` state updates
5. On submit, `addressData` object is constructed
6. Sent to PATCH `/api/listings/[id]` with all form data
7. API filters out undefined fields before database update

### Map Integration
Map component automatically updates when latitude/longitude change:
```typescript
const Map = useMemo(() => dynamic(() => import('../Map'), {
  ssr: false,
}), [addressFields.latitude, addressFields.longitude]);

// In JSX:
<Map
  center={addressFields.latitude && addressFields.longitude 
    ? [addressFields.latitude, addressFields.longitude] 
    : undefined
  }
/>
```

## Files Modified

1. **API Routes:**
   - `app/api/listings/route.ts` - Fixed POST address handling
   - `app/api/listings/[listingId]/route.ts` - Fixed PATCH address handling

2. **New Component:**
   - `app/components/inputs/AddressFieldsGroup.tsx` - Reusable address fields

3. **Modals:**
   - `app/components/modals/RentModal.tsx` - Hybrid UI for create
   - `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx` - Hybrid UI for edit

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Edit existing listing without changing address (no errors)
- [x] Edit existing listing with new autocomplete address
- [x] Edit existing listing with manual address changes
- [x] Create new listing with autocomplete
- [x] Create new listing with manual entry only
- [x] Map updates correctly with coordinates
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] All fields properly validated

## Benefits

1. **User Flexibility:** Users can choose their preferred input method
2. **Error Recovery:** Fixed 400 errors on listing edits
3. **Data Quality:** Users can correct autocomplete mistakes
4. **Mobile-Friendly:** Responsive grid layout adapts to screen size
5. **Maintainable:** Reusable AddressFieldsGroup component
6. **Type-Safe:** Full TypeScript support throughout

## Next Steps

The hybrid address UI is now complete and ready for production use. Future enhancements could include:
- Address validation (e.g., verify zip code format)
- Geocoding manual entries (get lat/lng from typed address)
- Address suggestions as user types in manual fields
- Save recently used addresses for quick access
