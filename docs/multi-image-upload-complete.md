# Multi-Image Upload - COMPLETE ✅

## Status
**WORKING PERFECTLY** - User confirmed functionality is working as expected.

## What Was Fixed
1. Cleared Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)
2. Exported CustomImageUploadProps interface for proper TypeScript type forwarding
3. Updated ImageUpload.tsx re-export to explicitly include type exports
4. Restarted dev server with fresh build

## Final Implementation
- ✅ Upload up to 35 images per listing
- ✅ 16:9 aspect ratio for all image previews
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (2-4 columns)
- ✅ Individual progress bars during upload
- ✅ Individual remove buttons for each image
- ✅ Image counter showing "X/35 images • Y remaining"
- ✅ Drag & drop multiple files
- ✅ File validation (size, type, count)
- ✅ Sequential upload (prevents crashes)
- ✅ Organized in Cloudinary (bookin/listings folder)
- ✅ Automatic image optimization (f_auto, q_auto:low)

## Files Modified
1. `app/components/inputs/CustomImageUpload.tsx` - Exported interface (debug logging removed)
2. `app/components/inputs/ImageUpload.tsx` - Updated re-export with type exports

## Ready for Next Task
Debug logging has been removed. Component is production-ready.
