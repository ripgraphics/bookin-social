# EditModal Form Data Loading Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem
The EditModal form submission was only containing `{category, address, guestCount, roomCount, bathroomCount}` but missing required fields: `title`, `description`, `imageSrc`, `price`. This caused a 400 error when trying to save listing edits.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **useEffect Dependency Issue**: The `useEffect` dependency array included the entire `editModal` object, causing excessive re-runs that interfered with form state.

2. **Form Data Collection Issue**: The `onSubmit` function was relying on the `data` parameter from `handleSubmit`, which only includes fields that were "touched" or explicitly watched. Fields set via `setValue()` were not being included.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Cleaned Up useEffect Dependencies
**File**: `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx` (Line 157)

**Before**:
```typescript
}, [editModal.isOpen, editModal.listingId, setValue, editModal]);
```

**After**:
```typescript
}, [editModal.isOpen, editModal.listingId, setValue]);
```

### Fix 2: Added Missing watch() Calls
**File**: `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx` (Lines 78-80)

Added watch calls for fields that were missing from form submission:
```typescript
const title = watch('title');
const description = watch('description');
const price = watch('price');
```

### Fix 3: Used getValues() for Form Submission
**File**: `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx`

**Line 56**: Added `getValues` to useForm destructuring:
```typescript
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  setValue,
  watch,
  getValues, // ADDED
  formState: { errors },
  reset
} = useForm<FieldValues>({
  // ...
});
```

**Line 187**: Changed `onSubmit` to use `getValues()`:
```typescript
const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<FieldValues> = () => { // Removed data parameter
  if (step !== STEPS.PRICE) {
    return onNext();
  }

  setIsLoading(true);

  // Get all form values directly
  const data = getValues(); // ADDED - Gets ALL form values

  // ... rest of submission logic
};
```

## Why This Works

`getValues()` retrieves ALL form values directly from the form state, regardless of whether they were:
- Touched by the user
- Watched via `watch()`
- Registered via `register()`

This ensures that fields populated via `setValue()` in the `useEffect` are included in the submission.

## Expected Outcome

After this fix:
- ✅ Form data will include all required fields: `title`, `description`, `imageSrc`, `price`, `category`, `guestCount`, `roomCount`, `bathroomCount`, `address`
- ✅ The PATCH request will succeed (200 status instead of 400)
- ✅ The listing will be updated successfully in the database
- ✅ The modal will close and show "Listing updated!" toast message

## Testing Instructions

1. Refresh the page to pick up the latest changes
2. Open the edit modal for a listing
3. Navigate through all steps to the final Price step
4. Click "Update"
5. Check browser console for:
   - `[EditModal] Form data:` - should now include title, description, imageSrc, price
   - `[EditModal] Sending PATCH request:` - should include all required fields
6. Verify the listing saves successfully (200 status, "Listing updated!" toast)

## Cleanup

After confirming the fix works, remove the temporary debug logging:
- Line 149-158: `console.log('[EditModal] Form populated with:', ...)`
- Line 217-219: Debug logs for form data, address data, and payload
