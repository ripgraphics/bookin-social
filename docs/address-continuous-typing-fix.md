# Address Input Continuous Typing Fix

## Problem
The address input field was disabled during search operations, forcing users to wait for the search to complete before they could continue typing. This created a poor user experience where users had to type, wait, type, wait, etc.

## Root Cause
The input field had `disabled={disabled || isLoading}` which prevented typing while the Nominatim API search was in progress (after the 1-second debounce).

## Solution
Removed the `isLoading` condition from the disabled state, allowing users to continue typing while the search happens in the background.

### Changes Made
1. **Input Field**: Changed `disabled={disabled || isLoading}` to `disabled={disabled}`
2. **Current Location Button**: Changed `disabled={disabled || isLoading}` to `disabled={disabled}`

## Benefits
- ✅ Users can type continuously without interruption
- ✅ Search happens in the background while user continues typing
- ✅ Much better user experience - no more waiting for searches
- ✅ Loading indicator still shows when search is in progress
- ✅ Debouncing still works to prevent excessive API calls

## Technical Details
- The debounce timer (1000ms) still prevents excessive API calls
- The loading indicator still shows when a search is in progress
- The input remains responsive and doesn't block user input
- Search results still appear when available, even if user is still typing

## Result
Users can now type "455 Oakdale Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30307" continuously without any interruptions, while the search happens seamlessly in the background.
