## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the display** - Create a listing with amenities to test the display
2. **Build admin pages** - Create the admin UI for managing amenities
3. **Add to listing forms** - Add amenities selection to create/edit forms
4. **Final testing** - End-to-end testing of the complete flow

- All backend infrastructure is in place

The system needs:
- Admin pages to manage amenities and categories
- Listing forms integration to assign amenities to listings
