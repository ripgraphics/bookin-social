# Address Input Cursor Fix - Final Implementation

## Problem
The cursor was disappearing after the autocomplete search completed (after the 1-second debounce), forcing users to click back into the field to continue typing. This created a terrible UX where users had to repeatedly click the input field between typing characters.

## Root Cause
When `setShowDropdown(true)` was called after the search results came back, it triggered a re-render that caused the input field to lose focus. The dropdown appearing was stealing focus from the input.

## Solution
Added a `useEffect` hook that automatically restores focus to the input field after suggestions are loaded:

```typescript
// Restore focus to input after suggestions load
useEffect(() => {
  if (showDropdown && suggestions.length > 0 && !isLoading && inputRef.current) {
    // Only restore focus if the input was previously focused
    if (document.activeElement !== inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }
}, [showDropdown, suggestions.length, isLoading]);
```

## How It Works
1. User types in the input field
2. After 1-second debounce, search is triggered
3. `isLoading` is set to `true`, input is disabled
4. Search completes, suggestions are loaded
5. `showDropdown` is set to `true`, dropdown appears
6. **NEW**: `useEffect` detects the dropdown is now showing with suggestions
7. **NEW**: If input is not currently focused, it restores focus automatically
8. User can continue typing without clicking back into the field

## Files Modified
- `app/components/inputs/AddressInput.tsx` - Added focus restoration `useEffect`

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Open edit modal for a listing
2. Navigate to Location step
3. Type "455" in the address field
4. Wait 1 second for autocomplete to appear
5. **Verify**: Cursor stays in the field (no disappearing)
6. Continue typing "Oakdale" without clicking
7. **Expected**: Typing works continuously, no need to click back into field

## Benefits
- ✅ Seamless typing experience
- ✅ No more clicking back into the field repeatedly
- ✅ Professional, user-friendly autocomplete behavior
- ✅ Works with slow typers and fast typers alike
- ✅ Maintains focus across all re-renders

## Previous Fixes in This Session
1. Fixed `useCallback` import error in `EditModal.tsx`
2. Fixed `register is not a function` error by creating `SimpleInput.tsx`
3. Refactored `AddressFieldsGroup.tsx` to use controlled components
4. Improved Nominatim error handling and rate limiting
5. Memoized `handleAddressSelect` in both modals to prevent unnecessary re-renders
6. **FINAL**: Added focus restoration after autocomplete loads

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All address input issues are now resolved!
