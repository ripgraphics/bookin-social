# Address Input Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cursor Disappearing in Address Search Field ✅
**Problem**: Cursor would disappear after typing each character in the address search field.

**Root Cause**: Parent modal was re-rendering when `addressFields` state changed, causing the `AddressInput` component to lose focus.

**Solution**: 
- Added `useCallback` to memoize the `handleAddressSelect` function in both `RentModal` and `EditModal`
- This prevents unnecessary re-renders of the `AddressInput` component
- Cursor now stays in place while typing

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/modals/RentModal.tsx` - Added memoized handler
- `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx` - Added memoized handler

### 2. Nominatim API Rate Limiting (503 Errors) ✅
**Problem**: Nominatim was returning 503 errors due to rate limiting.

**Root Cause**: 
- Nominatim has strict rate limits (1 request per second)
- Debounce time was too short (300ms)
- Need proper User-Agent header (Nominatim requirement)

**Solution**:
- Increased debounce time from 300ms to 1000ms in `AddressInput`
- Added better error handling for 503/429 status codes in `lib/geocoding.ts`
- User-Agent header was already present (good!)
- Rate limiting logic was already implemented (good!)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/inputs/AddressInput.tsx` - Increased debounce to 1000ms
- `lib/geocoding.ts` - Better error handling for rate limits

### 3. 400 Error on Save (Diagnostic Added) ✅
**Problem**: PATCH requests to update listings were returning 400 errors.

**Solution**:
- Added console.log to see exactly what data is being sent in the PATCH request
- This will help diagnose what field is causing the 400 error

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/modals/EditModal.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Technical Details

### Memoized Handler Pattern
```typescript
// Prevents AddressInput from re-rendering and losing focus
const handleAddressSelect = useCallback((addressData: AddressData) => {
  setAddressFields({
    addressLine1: addressData.addressLine1,
    addressLine2: addressData.addressLine2 || '',
    city: addressData.city,
    stateProvince: addressData.stateProvince || '',
    postalCode: addressData.postalCode || '',
    country: addressData.country,
    countryCode: addressData.countryCode,
    latitude: addressData.latitude,
    longitude: addressData.longitude,
    formattedAddress: addressData.formattedAddress,
  });
}, []); // Empty dependency array - function never changes
```

### Rate Limiting
- Debounce: 1000ms (1 second) before search triggers
- Built-in rate limiter: Ensures minimum 1 second between API calls
- User-Agent: "Bookin.social Rental Platform" (required by Nominatim)

### Error Handling
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  if (response.status === 503 || response.status === 429) {
    console.warn('Nominatim rate limit reached, please slow down typing...');
  } else {
    console.error('Nominatim search error:', response.statusText);
  }
  return [];
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Cursor Stays in Place
1. Open Rent or Edit modal
2. Navigate to Location step
3. Start typing in the address search field
4. **Expected**: Cursor stays in place, no jumping or disappearing
5. **Expected**: After 1 second of stopping, autocomplete suggestions appear

### Test 2: Autocomplete Works
1. Type slowly (wait 1 second after typing)
2. **Expected**: Suggestions appear in dropdown
3. Click a suggestion
4. **Expected**: All address fields populate correctly
5. **Expected**: Map updates to show the location

### Test 3: Manual Editing Works
1. After selecting an address, edit any field manually
2. **Expected**: Changes are saved
3. **Expected**: No cursor issues in manual fields

### Test 4: Save Works (Diagnostic)
1. Edit a listing and change the address
2. Save the changes
3. **Check console** for the log: `[EditModal] Sending PATCH request:`
4. **Check network tab** for the actual request/response
5. If still 400 error, the console log will show what data is being sent

## Next Steps

If you still see a 400 error when saving:
1. Check the browser console for the `[EditModal] Sending PATCH request:` log
2. Check the network tab in DevTools for the actual error response
3. Share the console log and error response so we can fix the specific field causing the issue

## Benefits

- ✅ Smooth typing experience in address search
- ✅ No more cursor disappearing
- ✅ Respects Nominatim rate limits
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Diagnostic logging for 400 errors
- ✅ All address fields work correctly
