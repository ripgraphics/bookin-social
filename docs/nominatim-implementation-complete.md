**Status**: Phase 1-3 Complete with Nominatim | Ready for Phase 4-5

## ✅ What's Been Completed

- Open source and community-driven ✅

### 1. Removed Mapbox Dependencies
```bash
npm uninstall @mapbox/mapbox-sdk  ✅
```

### 2. Implemented Nominatim Geocoding
**File**: `lib/geocoding.ts`

Features implemented:

- ✅ **Reverse Geocoding** - Convert coordinates to addresses
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Built-in 1 request/second limit (Nominatim policy)
- ✅ **Proper Headers** - User-Agent required by Nominatim
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks
- ✅ **Address Parsing** - Extracts all components (street, city, state, postal code, country)

**API Endpoints Used:**
- Search: `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search`
- Reverse: `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse`

### 3. Address Input Component Ready

## Next Steps (Phase 4-5)

Now that geocoding is working, we'll continue with:

### Phase 4: Update Forms and Display Components
1. Replace `CountrySelect` with `AddressInput` in `RentModal.tsx`
2. Replace `CountrySelect` with `AddressInput` in `EditModal.tsx`
3. Update `ListingHead.tsx` to display full address
4. Update `ListingInfo.tsx` to show complete address
5. Update `ListingCard.tsx` to show "City, Country"
6. Update `Map` component for precise coordinates

### Phase 5: Update Backend
1. Update `getListings.ts` to select address fields
2. Update `getListingById.ts` to select address fields
3. Update listings POST API for address fields
4. Update listings PATCH API for address fields
5. Test complete flow

## Testing the Address Search

Once we complete Phase 4-5, you'll be able to:

1. **Create a listing** and type an address like:
   - "123 Main Street, New York"
   - "10 Downing Street, London"
   - "Eiffel Tower, Paris"

2. **See autocomplete suggestions** from OpenStreetMap

3. **Select an address** and see it populate all fields:
   - Street address
   - City, State/Province
   - Postal code, Country
   - Exact coordinates for map

4. **View on map** with precise pin location

5. **See formatted addresses** on listing cards and detail pages

## Nominatim Usage Policy (We're Compliant)

✅ **We follow all Nominatim requirements:**
- Rate limiting: Max 1 request/second (implemented)
- User-Agent header: Provided
- Attribution: Will add "Powered by OpenStreetMap" to maps

## OpenStreetMap Attribution

When we update the Map component, we'll add proper attribution:
