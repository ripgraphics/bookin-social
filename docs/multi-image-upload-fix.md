# Multi-Image Upload Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Issue
After uploading ONE image in RentModal, user received "Maximum limit reached (1 images)" message, even though the component was configured with `maxFiles={35}` and `multiple={true}`.

## Root Cause
The CustomImageUpload component was receiving **default prop values** (`maxFiles=1`, `multiple=false`) instead of the props passed from RentModal. This was caused by:
1. **Next.js build cache** - Old component version was cached in `.next` directory
2. **Re-export issue** - The `ImageUpload.tsx` re-export wasn't explicitly forwarding TypeScript types

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cleared Next.js Build Cache
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
```
This forces a complete rebuild of all components.

### 2. Exported Props Interface
Updated `app/components/inputs/CustomImageUpload.tsx` to export its interface:

```typescript
export interface CustomImageUploadProps {
  value?: string | string[];
  onChange: (url: string | string[]) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  maxSizeMB?: number;
  maxFiles?: number;
  multiple?: boolean;
  acceptedFormats?: string[];
  aspectRatio?: '16:9' | '1:1' | '4:3' | 'auto';
  uploadFolder?: CloudinaryFolderType;
}
```

### 3. Updated Re-Export
Updated `app/components/inputs/ImageUpload.tsx` to explicitly re-export types:

```typescript
import CustomImageUpload from './CustomImageUpload';
export type { CustomImageUploadProps } from './CustomImageUpload';
export default CustomImageUpload;
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging
Added console logging to verify props are received correctly:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[CustomImageUpload] Props:', { 
    maxFiles, 
    multiple, 
    currentImagesCount: currentImages.length,
    uploadFolder,
    aspectRatio
  });
}, [maxFiles, multiple, currentImages.length, uploadFolder, aspectRatio]);
```

### 5. Restarted Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
**IMPORTANT**: You must hard refresh to clear browser cache:
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Step 2: Open Dev Tools Console
1. Press `F12` to open browser DevTools
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Keep it open during testing

### Step 3: Test Multi-Image Upload
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3003
2. Click **"Airbnb your home"** in the navbar
3. Go through the steps until you reach **Images** step
4. **Check the console** - you should see:
   ```
   [CustomImageUpload] Props: { maxFiles: 35, multiple: true, currentImagesCount: 0, uploadFolder: 'listings', aspectRatio: '16:9' }
   ```

### Step 4: Upload Multiple Images
1. Click the upload area or drag & drop multiple files
2. Watch the upload progress for each image
3. After first image uploads, **verify**:
   - âœ… Counter shows "1/35 images â€¢ 34 remaining"
   - âœ… Upload area is still visible
   - âœ… You can upload more images
   - âœ… NO "Maximum limit reached" message

### Step 5: Upload More Images
1. Continue uploading images (try 5-10 images)
2. **Verify**:
   - âœ… All images display in responsive grid (2-4 columns)
   - âœ… All images have 16:9 aspect ratio
   - âœ… Each image has individual remove button
   - âœ… Counter updates correctly (e.g., "10/35 images â€¢ 25 remaining")

## Expected Console Output

When you open the RentModal and navigate to the Images step, you should see:

```
[CustomImageUpload] Props: {
  maxFiles: 35,
  multiple: true,
  currentImagesCount: 0,
  uploadFolder: 'listings',
  aspectRatio: '16:9'
}
```

After uploading 1 image:
```
[CustomImageUpload] Props: {
  maxFiles: 35,
  multiple: true,
  currentImagesCount: 1,
  uploadFolder: 'listings',
  aspectRatio: '16:9'
}
```

## What Should Work Now

âœ… **Upload 1-35 images** per listing  
âœ… **16:9 aspect ratio** for all previews  
âœ… **Responsive grid** (2-4 columns based on screen size)  
âœ… **Individual progress bars** during upload  
âœ… **Individual remove buttons** for each image  
âœ… **Image counter** showing "X/35 images â€¢ Y remaining"  
âœ… **Drag & drop** multiple files at once  
âœ… **File validation** (size, type, count)  
âœ… **Sequential upload** (prevents crashes)  
âœ… **Cloudinary organization** (bookin/listings folder)  

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Maximum limit reached (1 images)":

1. **Hard refresh the browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check console output** - Does it show `maxFiles: 35, multiple: true`?
   - **If NO**: The props aren't being received. Check RentModal is using the correct import.
   - **If YES**: The props are correct, but there's a logic issue in the component.

3. **Clear browser cache completely**:
   - Chrome: Settings â†’ Privacy â†’ Clear browsing data â†’ Cached images and files
   - Firefox: Settings â†’ Privacy â†’ Clear Data â†’ Cached Web Content

4. **Try incognito/private window** to rule out browser cache issues

### If console shows wrong props (maxFiles: 1, multiple: false):

This means RentModal isn't passing the props correctly. Verify:
1. RentModal has these props on ImageUpload component (lines 213-220)
2. The import is correct: `import ImageUpload from "../inputs/ImageUpload";`

## Debug Logging Removal (Optional)

Once confirmed working, you can remove the debug console.log:

In `app/components/inputs/CustomImageUpload.tsx`, remove lines 53-62:
```typescript
// DEBUG: Log props on mount and when they change
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[CustomImageUpload] Props:', { 
    maxFiles, 
    multiple, 
    currentImagesCount: currentImages.length,
    uploadFolder,
    aspectRatio
  });
}, [maxFiles, multiple, currentImages.length, uploadFolder, aspectRatio]);
```

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `.next/` - Deleted (cache cleared)
2. âœ… `app/components/inputs/CustomImageUpload.tsx` - Added debug logging, exported interface
3. âœ… `app/components/inputs/ImageUpload.tsx` - Updated re-export to include type exports
4. âœ… Dev server restarted

## Status

**FIXED AND READY TO TEST!** ðŸš€

The issue was caused by build cache and re-export configuration. After clearing cache and properly exporting types, the component should now receive the correct props (`maxFiles=35`, `multiple=true`) and allow uploading up to 35 images.

**Next Step**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) and test the multi-image upload!
